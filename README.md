# Full Stack Redux Tree

This project store and present a folder tree. 

The project include DB- to store the folders, API server to traverse the tree, and client side that display the data.

CLIENT- by React Redux,
DB- I used MongoDB,
SERVER- written in Node.js- I used mongoos library (ORM) for access my DB,
I chose to write in Node.js and not Python, because Python I Know... and I wanted to experiment with a new technology.


## To run this project:

- `npm start`- in the root folder (Full Stack Redux Tree) or server directory,
- `npm start`- in client directory.


Runs the app, and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Enjoy!
